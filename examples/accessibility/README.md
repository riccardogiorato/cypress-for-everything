# accessibility A11Y

## Examples
- [cypress-axe](cypress/integration/cypress-axe.ts)

## How does it work? 

Test accessibility by using axe-core under the hood with "cypress-axe".
You can play with Axe directly with Chrome using their browser extension, you can download it: [axe-core](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd)    

## Setup

1. Install the packages "axe-core" & "cypress-axe" with
```
yarn add axe-core cypress-axe
```

2. Include the commands. Update cypress/support/index.js or [cypress/support/index.ts](cypress/support/index.ts) file to include the cypress-axe commands by adding:
```
import 'cypress-axe'
```

3. Write a simple test to check if the plugin is working: [cypress-axe](cypress/integration/cypress-axe.ts) âœ¨

Always remember to use first "cy.visit" then "cy.injectAxe" to make sure the axe-core is loaded and finally "cy.checkA11y" to check the accessibility.
```typescript
  it("A11Y on riccardogiorato.com", function () {
    cy.visit("https://www.riccardogiorato.com/");
    cy.injectAxe();
    cy.checkA11y(
      null,
      null,
      (violations) => {
        expect(violations.length).to.be.equal(1);
      },
      true
    );
  });
```
